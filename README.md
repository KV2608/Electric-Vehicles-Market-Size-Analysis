### Analysis of the Electric Vehicle Market

#### EV Adoption Over Time
We will analyze the growth of the EV population by model year to understand how the adoption of electric vehicles has progressed over time.

#### Geographical Distribution
We will analyze the geographical distribution of EV registrations to understand where EVs are most commonly registered.

#### EV Types
We will analyze the breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)).

#### Make and Model Popularity
We will identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.

#### Electric Range Analysis
We will analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.


The bar chart illustrates the adoption of electric vehicles over time. Key observations include:

- A noticeable increase in EV registrations starting around 2016.
- A significant upward trend from 2017 onwards, with the highest number of registrations in 2023.

### Geographical Distribution


The bar chart compares the number of electric vehicles registered in various cities within the top three counties: King, Snohomish, and Kitsap. Key findings include:

- **Seattle (King County)** has the highest number of EV registrations by a significant margin.
- **Bothell (Snohomish County)** and **Issaquah (King County)** follow, though with considerably fewer registrations than Seattle.
- King County dominates EV registrations among the three counties.


### Make and Model Popularity

Let's analyze the popularity of electric vehicle manufacturers and models to identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs. We'll start with the most popular manufacturers and then drill down into the most popular models within those manufacturers.

The bar chart shows that:

- **TESLA** leads by a substantial margin with the highest number of vehicles registered.
- **NISSAN** is the second most popular manufacturer, followed by **CHEVROLET**.
- Other manufacturers like **FORD**, **BMW**, **KIA**, **TOYOTA**, **VOLKSWAGEN**, **JEEP**, and **HYUNDAI** follow in decreasing order of registrations.
